## Chippy
Very WIP (i.e., not currently functional) in-browser chiptune tracker.

You can try working on it with this:
```
$ lein repl
# once the repl starts:
user=> (lets-go) ;; starts figwheel and a cljs repl
```

(Yeah, I know all the namespace say chipper right now)

#### Progress milestones:

Jan-18: selection is unfucked, still needs some optimization:
